Serket analytics
=======================

## Synopsis

Craftathon challenge based on data from serket

## Job list


- Refactor to separate model and views
- Refactor to make tools generic
- Add testing (jasmine??)
- Add menu options for things to view
- Look at chartjs options for on-the-fly view changes, especially axis changing/auto grouping of data

## Metrics to look at

- \# number of entries vs time period
- \# entries vs day / time of day
- drug vs time
- drug vs area vs time (chart js & gmaps??)
- drug vs pharmacy


- Accuracy vs date (pick up accuracy changes with evolving data capture)
- Accuracy vs pharmacy (pick up accuracy changes happening locally)

## Future work

- store an image of the printed label - would allow comparison by user (possible way of improving data capture if can use machine learning)
